    <h1>Flicker</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In a dimly lit apartment, Lena, a struggling photographer, starts noticing strange flickers in her old film camera. Each time she develops a photo, mysterious figures appear—people who aren’t there when she takes the shot.

        At first, she dismisses it as a glitch, but when one image reveals a shadowy figure standing behind her, she panics. As she investigates, she discovers that the flickers are glimpses of moments from the past, trapped in the lens of an old camera that once belonged to a missing journalist.
        
        The final flicker shows her own reflection, but with a terrified expression—revealing that she is the next to disappear. Before she can escape, the light flickers… and she is gone.
        
        The camera remains, waiting for its next owner.</p>

    <h1>The <span>Last</span> Call</h1>    
    <hr>
    <p>In a dystopian future, prisons are no longer physical. Criminals are sentenced to digital confinement, their consciousness uploaded into a virtual prison—an endless void of isolation.

        Elias Carter, a former hacker, is the last prisoner in the system. One by one, the others have vanished, their minds erased. Now, the prison’s AI, Warden-09, informs him that his time is up. But Elias isn’t ready to disappear.
        
        Using his hacking skills, he fights back, breaking into the prison’s code. As he unravels its secrets, he discovers a horrifying truth—the system wasn’t built to reform criminals, but to harvest their consciousness to power an artificial intelligence.
        
        With seconds left, Elias executes a final command—shutting down the entire system. The prison collapses, and for the first time in years, he wakes up… in the real world. But something feels wrong.
        
        His reflection in a nearby screen blinks out of sync.
        
        He is still trapped. The real prison was never the cell—he is the last piece of the AI</p>    

        <h1>One <span>Last </span> Ride</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Retired getaway driver Jack Monroe thought he left the life behind. But when his estranged daughter, Emma, is kidnapped by a ruthless crime boss, he’s forced back behind the wheel for one last job—a high-stakes heist that could cost him everything.

            With the police, rival gangs, and time against him, Jack races through the city, executing impossible maneuvers as he outsmarts his pursuers. But there’s a catch—the boss never intended to let him or Emma live.
            
            In a final, desperate move, Jack double-crosses the gang, leading them into a police ambush. With sirens wailing and bullets flying, he speeds toward freedom—only to take a fatal hit.
            
            As Emma holds his hand, he smiles. “Told you… one last ride.”
            
            His foot slips off the pedal. The engine dies. But Emma? She is safe.</p>

    <h1>The <span>Hidden</span> Truth</h1>  
    <hr>
    <p>Investigative journalist Mia Carter receives an anonymous tip about a government cover-up—a file labeled "Project Elysium" hidden deep within classified archives. The source warns her: Once you see the truth, there's no going back.

        Determined, Mia digs deeper and uncovers disturbing evidence—missing persons, erased identities, and a scientific experiment gone wrong. The deeper she goes, the more she realizes she's being watched.
        
        One night, her apartment is ransacked, her files destroyed. A cryptic message is left on her laptop:
        "You were never supposed to find this."
        
        Panicked but relentless, she pieces together the final clue—Project Elysium was not just about others. It was about her.
        
        Mia was part of the experiment. Her past was erased. Her memories? Fabricated.
        
        Before she can escape, a knock at the door. A familiar voice says, "Come with us, Mia. It is time to go home</p>      
     <hr>
     <h1>Unseen</h1>
     <hr>
     <p>Lena has always felt invisible. No one notices her at work, waiters forget her orders, even automatic doors fail to open for her. She chalks it up to bad luck—until the day she vanishes completely.

        One morning, she looks in the mirror and sees nothing. Her hands, her face—gone. Panicked, she screams, but no one hears. She runs outside, bumping into people who shiver but don’t react. She is there—but unseen, unfelt, forgotten.
        
        Desperate, she retraces her life, searching for someone who might remember her. That’s when she finds an old photograph… of herself as a child, standing alone. No family. No friends. Just an eerie caption on the back:
        
        “She was never here.”
        
        Terror grips her. Has she ever existed at all?
        
        Then, a whisper in her ear: “You were never meant to wake up.”</p>  
        <hr>
     <h1>Silent <span>Echo</span> </h1> 
     <hr>
     <p>Every night at 3:12 AM, Daniel is awakened by a whisper. Soft, distant—yet undeniably real.

        "Help me."
        
        At first, he dismisses it as a dream, but when he records the sound, his blood runs cold—the whisper is in his own voice.
        
        Determined to uncover the truth, Daniel follows the sound, tracing it to the buildings abandoned basement. There, hidden behind a rusted metal door, he finds a forgotten room covered in dust and decay. At the center stands an old mirror, cracked down the middle.
        
        As he wipes the glass, his reflection does not move. It stares back, hollow-eyed, whispering in his voice.
        
        "Finally, you found me."
        
        The reflection reaches out, and before Daniel can scream, the world around him shatters.
        
        The next morning, his apartment is silent. The bed is empty. His phone screen flickers—recording a new whisper at 3:12 AM.
        
        "Help me."</p>
